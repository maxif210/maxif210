Hi I'm Maximiliano 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

I'm a Frontend Developer who is passionate about learning web programing, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, JavaScript and for the styles I prefer boostrap, tailwind or pure CSS. In 2020 I finished my master in javascript and since then my desire to learn and write quality code does not stop exciting me.
